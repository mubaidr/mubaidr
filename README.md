### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a web developer with more than 4 years of experience and a degree in the Computer & Information Sciences, love for coffee and passionate about open source. 


Looking for an opportunity to work and upgrade, as well as being involved in an organization that believes in gaining a competitive edge and giving back to the community.
